# ettil: Edit the Text Interface Library
ettil is a simple library that makes it a lot easier to interface with Tikolu's [Edit the Text](https://tikolu.net/edit/).

## How do I update/install it?
I will be trying to get this on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) soon, but for now:
- Obtain the source by either:
  - Downloading it via the green **Code** button and and extracting it, *OR*
  - Running `git clone https://github.com/tlras/ettil`.
- Go into this new directory.
- Run `./setup.py install` on **\*nix**, OR `python3 setup.py install` on **Windows**.

## How do I use it?
Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/tlras/ettil/wiki) for more information on usage.
